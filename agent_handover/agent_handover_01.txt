VIBIFY PROJECT - COMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY & HANDOFF
🎯 PROJECT OVERVIEW
Vibify is a professional Spotify clone built as a monorepo with Python FastAPI backend and Next.js 14 frontend. The project emphasizes scalability for 10k+ songs, full-text search, and modern development practices.
🏗️ ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS
Monorepo Structure:
Backend: src/backend/ - Python FastAPI with UV package management
Frontend: src/frontend/ - Next.js 14 + TypeScript + React
Shared: src/shared/ - Common types and utilities
Root: Orchestrates both services with npm and concurrently
Technology Stack:
Backend: FastAPI + Supabase (PostgreSQL) + Backblaze B2 (storage)
Frontend: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
Package Management: UV (Python) + npm (Node.js)
Database: Supabase with Row Level Security and full-text search
📊 DATABASE SCHEMA (FINAL)
Core Tables:
songs - Main music metadata with search_vector for full-text search
playlists - User-created playlists
liked_songs - User favorites
song_plays - Recently played tracking (capped at 100 per user)
tags + song_tags - Genre categorization system
uploads + upload_validations - Upload tracking and validation
Key Features Supported:
✅ Full-text search across title, artist, album
✅ Genre filtering via tags system
✅ Recently played auto-playlist
✅ User playlists and favorites
✅ Album pages and management
✅ Upload system with validation
✅ Scalable for 10k+ songs
�� RECENT MAJOR FIXES COMPLETED
1. Centralized Logging System ✅
Created: src/backend/app/config/logging.py - Centralized logging configuration
Fixed: Replaced ALL print() statements with proper logging throughout backend
Benefits: Consistent logging, configurable levels, file output to src/backend/logs/
2. Settings Configuration ✅
Upgraded: src/backend/app/config/settings.py - Now uses Pydantic for type safety
Added: pydantic-settings>=2.0.0 dependency
Benefits: Automatic validation, type safety, better error handling
3. Missing Utility Files ✅
Created: src/backend/app/utils/validators.py - File validation utilities
Created: src/backend/app/utils/helpers.py - General helper functions
Created: src/backend/app/config/env.py - Environment variable utilities
4. Test Structure Cleanup ✅
Fixed: Removed duplicate test files
Organized: Tests mirror app structure in src/backend/tests/app/
Added: Proper pytest configuration with fixtures
5. Script Integration ✅
Moved: upload_to_supabase.py to src/backend/scripts/
Updated: All scripts now use centralized logging and settings
Fixed: Import paths and environment variable handling

⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES & TODOS
Immediate TODOs:
Test Mocking: test_validate_song_files needs proper B2 client mocking
Import Paths: Some scripts still use sys.path.append() - consider package structure
Environment Loading: Ensure .env file is properly loaded in all contexts
Future Enhancements:
Authentication: Implement user auth with Supabase
Real-time Features: Add real-time updates for playlists
Audio Player: Implement Howler.js audio player
Search UI: Build advanced search interface
Mobile Responsive: Ensure mobile-first design
📋 DEVELOPMENT NOTES
Code Quality:
Logging: All backend code uses centralized logging (no print statements)
Type Safety: Pydantic settings with validation
Testing: Organized test structure with proper fixtures
Documentation: project-structure.txt is living documentation
Performance Considerations:
Database: Optimized for 10k+ songs with proper indexes
Search: Full-text search with GIN indexes
Pagination: Built-in pagination for large datasets
Caching: Ready for Redis integration
Security:
RLS: Row Level Security enabled on all tables
Validation: File validation for uploads
Environment: Secure environment variable handling
�� NEXT STEPS FOR NEW AGENT
Review: Check project-structure.txt for current architecture
Test: Run npm run test to verify everything works
Environment: Set up .env file from env.example
Development: Use npm run dev to start both services
Features: Focus on implementing frontend components and API endpoints
Database: Verify Supabase schema matches the design
Documentation: Keep project-structure.txt updated with changes
💡 ARCHITECTURAL INSIGHTS
Monorepo Benefits: Single codebase, shared types, coordinated development
UV + npm: Modern package management for both Python and Node.js
Pydantic Settings: Type-safe configuration with validation
Centralized Logging: Consistent debugging and monitoring
Test Organization: Mirrors app structure for maintainability
Environment Management: Centralized configuration with validation
The project is now in a professional, maintainable state ready for feature development! 🚀
